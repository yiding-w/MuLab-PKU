              Welcome to Muhan's Research Lab!

            MŒº Lab is dedicated to pursuing principled and transformative research in artificial intelligence and machine learning. While our current focus spans graph learning and large language models, our long-term mission is broader: to accelerate the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and deepen the scientific understanding of intelligence itself. We strive to combine theoretical rigor with practical impact, designing algorithms that are not only powerful but also explainable, efficient, and generalizable across diverse dimensions.

          <p style="font-size: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><strong>Thank you so much for your interest in our work!</strong> We are actively looking for students and postdocs. MuLab welcomes applicants from diverse backgrounds.</p>
          
          <p><strong>üéì Prospective PhD Students:</strong> We are always looking for strong PhD students with interests in Graph Machine Learning and Large Language Model Reasoning. I am looking for students who meet at least three criteria: creativity and passion for research, solid math skills, solid coding skills, and good English. <em>Note: Please do not email regarding PhD admission as decisions are made by committee.</em></p>
          
          <p><strong>üéØ PKU Undergraduate and Masters Students:</strong> We are happy to work with masters or undergraduate students at Peking University. We expect some prior experience in ML/AI and a minimum of 10 hours per week commitment. You are especially welcome if you have interdisciplinary backgrounds while being proficient in coding.</p>
          
          <p><strong>üåç Visiting Students and Researchers:</strong> We take visitors on a rolling basis, and generally prefer visitors to stay for at least 6 months for high-quality collaborative work. Please email Prof. Zhang with your research interests and proposed duration.</p>
          
          <p><strong>üìß How to Apply:</strong> Email <strong>muhan@pku.edu.cn</strong> with subject line: [Application Type] - [Your Name] - [Your Institution]. Due to the large number of applicants, I may not be able to respond to every email. Thank you for understanding!</p>
          
          <p><strong>üìç Location:</strong> I am mainly affiliated with the Institute for AI (‰∫∫Â∑•Êô∫ËÉΩÁ†îÁ©∂Èô¢) at the main campus (ÁáïÂõ≠) of PKU. Your office will be there - no need to go to Changping campus.</p>
