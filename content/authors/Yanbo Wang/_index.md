I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Technology at Peking University, advised by Prof. Muhan Zhang. My research focuses on the evolving world of relational databases. I'm passionate about exploring a variety of topics, from using relational & structured deep learning to understand relational data to leveraging language models or synthetic data for tabular data design and analysis. My work also extends to general graph neural networks, where I've investigated their expressiveness, temporal applications, and ability to predict links. Essentially, I'm dedicated to using cutting-edge methods to extract new insights from structured and relational data. If you're interested in connecting or collaborating on these topics, please don't hesitate to reach out.
