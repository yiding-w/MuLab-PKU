Yiding Wang is a junior undergraduate student at Peking University, majoring in Artificial Intelligence. Currently, I am a member of Mu Lab, advised by Prof.Muhan Zhang. My research in Mu focuses on enhancing the efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) Reasoning and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT). Previously, I conducted research in Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence (BIGAI), developing human-like social agents under the mentorship of Prof.Fangwei Zhong. I am also fortunate to visit Prof.Yu Meng and Prof.Jiaxuan You’s Lab and collaborate with them as an intern.

In general, my research interests lie in:

1. The revolution leads to the next generation of foundational models.  
2. Adapting foundation models more effectively to the field of agents, aiming to construct agents with general intelligence（eg. social interaction, adaptive decision-making, long-horizon planning).
