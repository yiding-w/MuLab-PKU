I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Peking University, where I am advised by Prof. Muhan Zhang. My research focuses on parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) and efficient inference for long-context LLMs. I have served as a reviewer for leading conferences and journals, including NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, TPAMI, COLM, AAAI, and IJCAI.

Prior to joining Peking University, I earned my Masterâ€™s degree from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, and gained over two years of research experience at Tencent YouTu Lab.
