I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Peking University, co-supervised by Prof. Muhan Zhang and Prof. Jianzhu Ma. My research focuses on computational biology and AI for science, particularly structural molecular biology. I work on generative molecular modeling, including PPI interactions, molecular design and molecular structure prediction.
